 This project is a security application built on top of the DES implementation in project 1. The topic selected is
 similar to the given topic: Secure communication. The main goal of this application is to encrypt the data transferred
 between two users who are engaging in an interactive session of data exchange. Through a user interface, users can
 send and receive message (or files) which are performed independently from each other during which the data (or files)
 must be encrypted using DES while in transmission.
